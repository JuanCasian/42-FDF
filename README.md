# FDF
FDF is the first project in the graphics branch at 42 School Silicon Valley. In this project I needed to create a three dimensional graphical representation of a map given in the following format:

In which the position of the numbers give the 'x' and 'y' coordinate while the numbr itself represent the 'z' coordinate. There are several bonus which added to the problem. In my case I did the rotation of the figure in all the axes, the instructions printed in the screen, the borders, the zoom in and out and the posibility to change the height of the objects. Below is an example of the result of the previous map:
